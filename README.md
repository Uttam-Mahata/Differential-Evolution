# Differential Evolution Optimization of Polynomial Weights

This project aims to optimize the weights of a polynomial model using **Differential Evolution (DE)** to best fit a noisy dataset sampled from the function $ \cos(x) $. The optimization minimizes the Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) between the polynomial model predictions and the noisy data.

### 1. **Polynomial Model Definition**

The polynomial model used here can be represented as:

$$
f(x; w) = \sum_{i=0}^{n} w_i \cdot x^i
$$

where:
- $ f(x; w) $ is the model's predicted output for an input $ x $,
- $ w = [w_0, w_1, \dots, w_n] $ are the polynomial weights,
- $ n $ is the degree of the polynomial.

### 2. **Objective: RMSE Minimization**

The **Root Mean Square Error (RMSE)** between the model's predictions $ y_{\text{pred}} $ and the noisy observed data $ y_{\text{noisy}} $ is calculated as:

$$
\text{RMSE} = \sqrt{\frac{1}{N} \sum_{j=1}^{N} (y_{\text{pred}}(x_j) - y_{\text{noisy}}(x_j))^2}
$$

where $ N $ is the number of data points. The goal is to find $ w $ that minimizes RMSE.

### 3. **Differential Evolution Algorithm**

The DE optimization iteratively refines a **population** of candidate solutions. Each individual in the population represents a potential weight vector $ w $.

#### Parameters:
- **Mutation Factor (F):** Controls the scaling of the difference vector.
- **Crossover Rate (CR):** Probability of recombining components from mutation vectors with the original vector.

#### Algorithm Steps:

1. **Mutation**: For each candidate vector $ w_i $, select three other vectors $ w_{r1}, w_{r2}, w_{r3} $ and create a **mutation vector** as:

   $$
   \text{mutation} = w_{r1} + F \cdot (w_{r2} - w_{r3})
   $$

2. **Crossover**: Create a **trial vector** by combining elements from $ w_i $ and the mutation vector based on the crossover rate $ CR $:

   $$
   \text{trial}_j = 
   \begin{cases} 
      \text{mutation}_j & \text{if } \text{rand} < CR \\
      w_{i,j} & \text{otherwise}
   \end{cases}
   $$

3. **Selection**: Evaluate both the trial vector and the original vector. Replace $ w_i $ with the trial vector if the trial vector yields a lower RMSE.

#### Termination:
After a fixed number of generations, the best vector (weights $ w $) with the lowest RMSE is considered the optimal solution.

### 4. **Results and Visualization**

The optimized weights are used to generate a polynomial fit for the data. The optimization progress (RMSE over generations) and the final fit are visualized.

This readme mathematically details how Differential Evolution optimizes the polynomial weights to minimize the RMSE between the polynomial model and noisy observations. The DE approach and visual plots illustrate the model's fit to data and the efficacy of the DE optimization technique.
